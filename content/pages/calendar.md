{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

1. Are there good reasons to worry that weapons with recognition capacities will be more harmful than “automatic” weapons with no such capacity, such as contact land mines and sea mines? Why aren't “smart weapons” better than the “dumb weapons” that preceded them?
2. Are there good reasons to think robots operating on the ground would be more destructive than weapons used in past wars, such as aerial bombardment or artillery shelling (with notoriously poor accuracy)? Or is there some ethical objection to loss of human control, apart from the likely scale of casualties or destruction?
3. Are there good reasons to think “autonomous weapons” are more objectionable than autonomous passenger vehicles, given that both may cause injury if they malfunction? Are mistakes of machines more objectionable than mistakes of human operators?
4. Historically (and still to some extent today), the law of war has claimed more trust for—because it attributed more honor or sound judgement to—officers than lower ranks. If we worry about relegating decisions to machines, should we emphasize the importance of “human control” or rather focus on the kinds of humans at the controls?
5. Do you believe “autonomous” “killer robots” in U.S. arsenals will pose more risk to the world than atomic weapons under the personal control of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un of North Korea or Ayatollah (and “Supreme Leader”) Ali Khamenei of Iran? If you were guiding the foreign policy of the European Union, which risk would you focus on?
